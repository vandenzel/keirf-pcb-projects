# Greaseweazle

This is a fork of [Keir Fraser](https://github.com/keirf)'s design for a very simple Greaseweazle hardware implementation consisting of just one STM32 Blue Pill and four or five pull-up resistors.

This design is upgraded to the KiCAD 6 file naming and formatting scheme (`*.kicad_pro` instead of `*.pro`).
